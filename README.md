# Magist Project

This is the first project in WBS data science bootcamp.

It includes following folders:
- Code
- Data
- Presentation

Magist's database was provided by the WBS coding school as a sql dump file.
The database was explored in mySQL workbench, the data was visualized in [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/views/magist_16827763335580/Sheet3?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) and then presented via [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_b9U14RDrAcJrGgIwOe81FKl6e1sTfYHh907my0AbVc/edit?usp=sharing)  in collaboration with Naeimeh S.

The scope of the project was to investigate whether Eniac, an online marketplace specialized in high-end tech products, should invest in expanding to the Brazilian market via Magist, a Brazilian Software as a Service company that offers a centralized order management system to connect small and medium-sized stores with the biggest Brazilian marketplaces.
