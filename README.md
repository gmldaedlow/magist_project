# Magist Project

This is the first project in WBS data science bootcamp.

It includes following folders:
- Code
- Data
- Presentation

Magist's database was provided by the WBS coding school as a sql dump file.
The database was explored in mySQL workbench, the data was visualized in Tableau Public and then presented via Google Slides in collaboration with Naeimeh S.

The scope of the project was to investigate whether Eniac, an online marketplace specialized in high-end tech products, should invest in expanding to the Brazilian market via Magist, a Brazilian Software as a Service company that offers a centralized order management system to connect small and medium-sized stores with the biggest Brazilian marketplaces.
